        Snorlax is a very large and fat, bear-like Pokémon that has grayish-blue fur and an apricot-color underbelly. <br />
        Its eyes are always closed, making it look as if it is sleeping.<br /><br />
        Behavior<br />
        Snorlax is known for its relaxed and somewhat-sluggish nature. <br />
        It will sleep all day until it is hungry, when it will awake and forage for the 880 pounds (399 kilograms) of food it needs, afterwards falling back to sleep again.<br />
        Because of its eating habits, it can interfere with human farming by destroying crops for food, but it is also believed to release a kind of energy to help new plants grow wherever it ate.<br />
        In the wild, it will ignore most people and Pokémon while it is eating or sleeping, but tends to be very affectionate towards its Trainer after being caught.
